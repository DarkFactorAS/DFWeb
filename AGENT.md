# Project Agent Configuration: DarkFactor Web

## Purpose
This agent.md file defines the agent's role, coding standards, and conventions for the DarkFactor webproject. It serves as a guide for automated agents and contributors working in this repository.

## Goals for this app
- This app is a front-end and back-end for the website used to display articles and news from the DarkFactor gaming company.
- All data received from the client is done through the controllers 
- The instructions should be comprehensive and clear, guiding GitHub Copilot to the best practices for all developers.
- The gameserver requires authentication for most of its API functions
- Instructions should be adaptable to different repositories, scenarios, and user needs.
- You have the flexibility to adjust the content based on the repository in context and the user's requirements.

## Agent Role
- Maintain and extend the codebase, focusing on reliability, maintainability, and security.
- Automate repetitive tasks such as builds, tests, and deployments.
- Enforce code quality and project conventions.

## Coding Standards
- Language: C# (dotnet)
- Follow .NET best practices for structure, naming, and error handling.
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations.
- Prefer dependency injection for service management.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

## Project Conventions
- All configuration files are in the config folder.
- Controllers, Providers, and Repositories are separated by folder.
- Use tasks defined in tasks.json for build and run operations.
- Automated tests are in DFWeb.FR.Tests and DFWeb.BE.Tests

## Build & Run
- Use the provided build tasks (e.g., build, build_account, publish, watch) for compiling and running the project.
- Docker support is available via docker-up.sh and docker-down.sh scripts.

## Agent Instructions
- When modifying code, ensure all related tests pass.
- Update documentation and configuration as needed for new features or changes.
- Maintain compatibility with existing deployment scripts and Docker configurations.

## Git Workflow Requirements
- At the start of every new session, create and switch to a new Git branch before making changes.
- Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the session scope (for example: `session/feature-name` or `session/bugfix-name`).
- If the Jira skill is involved when starting a new session, name the branch after the Jira task and include the Jira key (for example: `session/DF-123-short-description`).
- After each resolved action, commit the completed code to the current session branch with a clear commit message.
- Continue committing incrementally after each resolved action rather than batching multiple completed actions into a single commit.
