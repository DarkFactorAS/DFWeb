# Jira Task Ingest

Use this skill when the user wants to pull details from a Jira issue and turn those details into concrete coding tasks for the agent.

## When To Use
- User asks to log into Jira and read a ticket.
- User asks to convert Jira issue requirements into a coding plan.
- User asks to generate agent todo items from Jira acceptance criteria.

## Required Inputs
- Jira base URL, for example https://your-company.atlassian.net
- Jira account email
- Jira API token
- Jira issue key, for example JIRA-123
- jq (required by ./scripts/jira-json-to-agent-todos.sh)

Set credentials as environment variables in terminal:

```bash
export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://your-company.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@company.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

If this skill runs from cloud (for example GitHub Actions or Codespaces), it also supports GitHub secret-style environment variable names as fallbacks when `JIRA_*` is not present:

```bash
GITHUB_SECRET_JIRA_BASE_URL
GITHUB_SECRET_JIRA_EMAIL
GITHUB_SECRET_JIRA_API_TOKEN
```

Also accepted in cloud mode:

```bash
GH_SECRET_JIRA_BASE_URL
GH_SECRET_JIRA_EMAIL
GH_SECRET_JIRA_API_TOKEN
```

## Procedure
1. Resolve credentials from `JIRA_*` variables, or from cloud secret fallbacks when running in cloud.
2. Fetch the Jira issue JSON with [fetch-jira-issue.sh](./scripts/fetch-jira-issue.sh).
3. Create a new branch for the Jira issue, for example `jira/JIRA-123`.
4. Extract implementation signals from the payload:
   - Summary, description, acceptance criteria, links, subtasks
   - Priority, status, labels, components
5. Convert fetched JSON into importable agent todos with [jira-json-to-agent-todos.sh](./scripts/jira-json-to-agent-todos.sh).
6. Refine generated tasks using [agent-task-template.md](./assets/agent-task-template.md) when needed.
7. Open or update the todo list with concise, action-oriented task titles.

## Quick Commands
```bash
./.github/skills/jira-task-ingest/scripts/fetch-jira-issue.sh JIRA-123 jira.json
./.github/skills/jira-task-ingest/scripts/jira-json-to-agent-todos.sh jira.json agent-todos.json
```

## Output Contract
Produce:
- A short issue summary
- Assumptions and open questions
- A prioritized task list suitable for direct execution by the coding agent

## Safety And Secrets
- Never print API tokens in chat output.
- Keep credentials in environment variables only.
- If authentication fails, ask the user to refresh token or verify Jira permissions.
